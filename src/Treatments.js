                <h3>At-home treatment</h3>
                <p>Most people who become sick with <abbr title="coronavirus disease 2019">COVID-19</abbr> will only have mild illness and can get better at home. Symptoms might last a few days. People who have the virus might feel better in about a week. Treatment is aimed at relieving symptoms and includes:</p><div id="ad-mobile-top-container"></div>

                <ul>
                    <li>Rest</li>
                    <li>Fluids</li>
                    <li>Pain relievers</li>
                </ul>

                <p>But adults over age 65 and people of any age with existing long-lasting (chronic) medical conditions should call their health care provider as soon as symptoms start. These factors put people at greater risk of becoming seriously ill with <abbr title="coronavirus disease 2019">COVID-19</abbr>. People with these conditions who get <abbr title="coronavirus disease 2019">COVID-19</abbr> may also be eligible for certain treatments. These treatments need to start within a few days after symptoms start.</p>

                <p>Follow the health care provider's suggestions about care and staying at home (isolating). Talk to the provider if you have any questions about treatments. Help the sick person get food and any medication needed. And, if needed, take care of the person's pet.</p>

                <p>Also think about how caring for a sick person might affect your health. If you are age 65 or older or have an existing long-lasting (chronic) medical condition, such as heart or lung disease or diabetes, you may be at higher risk of serious illness with <abbr title="coronavirus disease 2019">COVID-19</abbr>. You might think about staying away from the sick person and finding another person to provide care. Also, you might choose to wear a face mask that gives higher protection.</p>

                <div class="auto">

                </div>

                <p>Carefully watch yourself or your loved one for signs and symptoms that are getting worse.</p>

                <p>The health care provider might suggest use of a home pulse oximeter, especially if the sick person has risk factors for severe illness with <abbr title="coronavirus disease 2019">COVID-19</abbr> and <abbr title="coronavirus disease 2019">COVID-19</abbr> symptoms. A pulse oximeter is a plastic clip that attaches to a finger. The device can help check breathing by measuring how much oxygen is in the blood. A reading of less than 92% might increase the need for staying in the hospital. If the provider recommends a pulse oximeter, make sure you understand how to use the device properly. And make sure you know when a reading should prompt a call to the provider.</p><div id="ad-mobile-top-container"></div>

                <p>If symptoms seem to be getting worse, call the provider.</p>

                <p>If you or the person with <abbr title="coronavirus disease 2019">COVID-19</abbr> has emergency warning signs, get medical attention right away. Call 911 or your local emergency number if you notice any emergency signs, including:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Trouble breathing</li>
                    <li>Persistent chest pain or pressure</li>
                    <li>New confusion</li>
                    <li>Trouble staying awake</li>
                    <li>Pale, gray or blue-colored skin, lips or nail beds &mdash; depending on skin tone</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This list doesn't include all symptoms. Call the provider if you or the person with <abbr title="coronavirus disease 2019">COVID-19</abbr> has other severe symptoms.</p>
                <h3>Protecting others if you're ill</h3>
                <p>If you have <abbr title="coronavirus disease 2019">COVID-19</abbr> symptoms, get tested as soon as you can after your symptoms start. Stay home until you receive results.</p>

                <p>If you're ill with <abbr title="coronavirus disease 2019">COVID-19</abbr>, you can help prevent the spread of the <abbr title="coronavirus disease 2019">COVID-19</abbr> virus.</p><div id="ad-mobile-top-container"></div>

                <ul>
                    <li>Stay home from work, school and public areas unless it's to get medical care.</li>
                    <li>Avoid using public transportation, ride-sharing services or taxis.</li>
                    <li>Stay isolated in one room, away from your family, others and pets, as much as you can. Eat in your room. Open windows to keep air moving. Fans can help direct air out of windows.</li>
                    <li>If you can't open windows, consider using air filters. And turn on exhaust fans in your bathroom and kitchen. You might also consider a portable air cleaner. Use a separate bathroom if you can.</li>
                    <li>Avoid shared space in your home as much as you can. When using shared spaces, limit your movements. Make sure your kitchen and other shared spaces have good air flow. Stay at least 6 feet (2 meters) away from your family members.</li>
                    <li>Clean often-touched surfaces in your separate room and bathroom, such as doorknobs, light switches, electronics and counters, every day.</li>
                    <li>Avoid sharing personal household items, such as dishes, towels, bedding and electronics such as phones.</li>
                    <li>Wear the most protective face mask that you'll wear regularly, fits well and is comfortable when near others or pets. Change the face mask each day.</li>
                    <li>Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue or elbow when coughing or sneezing. Then throw away the tissue.</li>
                    <li>Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water aren't nearby, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that has at least 60% alcohol.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Protecting yourself while caring for someone with COVID-19</h3>
                <p>To protect yourself while caring for someone with <abbr title="coronavirus disease 2019">COVID-19</abbr>, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO) recommend:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Keep your hands clean and away from your face.</strong> Wash your hands with soap and water often for at least 20 seconds. This is especially important to do after being in close contact or in the same room as the sick person. If soap and water aren't nearby, use a hand sanitizer that has at least 60% alcohol. Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth.</li>
                    <li><strong>Wear a face mask.</strong> If you need to be in the same room with the person who is ill, wear the most protective face mask that you'll wear regularly, fits well and is comfortable. Don't have any direct physical contact with the person. Don't touch or handle your mask while you are using it. If your mask gets wet or dirty, swap it with a clean, dry mask. Throw away the used mask and wash your hands.</li>
                    <li><strong>Clean your home often.</strong> Use household cleaning sprays or wipes to clean surfaces that are often touched, such as counters, tabletops and doorknobs. Avoid cleaning the sick person's separate room and bathroom. Set aside bedding and utensils for the sick person only to use.</li>
                    <li><strong>Avoid direct contact with the sick person's fluids.</strong> Wear gloves and a face mask when providing care and when handling stool, urine or other waste. Before you put on your gloves and mask, wash your hands. Also wash your hands after removing your gloves and mask. Don't reuse your mask or gloves.</li>
                    <li><strong>Avoid having visitors in your home.</strong> Don't allow visitors until the sick person has completely gotten better and doesn't have any <abbr title="coronavirus disease 2019">COVID-19</abbr> signs or symptoms.</li>
                </ul>
